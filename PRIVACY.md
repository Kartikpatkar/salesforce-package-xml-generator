# 🔒 Privacy Policy – Salesforce Package XML Generator

*Last updated: December 2025*

**Salesforce Package XML Generator** is built with **developer privacy, security, and transparency** as core principles.
The extension is designed to work **entirely within your browser** and **only with your existing Salesforce session**.

We believe that **your Salesforce data should remain under your control at all times**.

---

## 🛡️ What This Extension Does

**Salesforce Package XML Generator** helps Salesforce developers to:

* Detect the currently active Salesforce org
* Browse Salesforce metadata types and components
* Generate accurate `package.xml` files for deployments
* Prepare partial or full deployment packages visually

All logic and processing happen **locally in your browser**, using Salesforce’s **official APIs**.

---

## 🔐 Data Collection

Salesforce Package XML Generator **does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data**.

Specifically:

* ❌ No analytics or tracking
* ❌ No user profiling
* ❌ No advertising
* ❌ No external servers or middleware
* ❌ No data sent to third-party services

The extension **does not log, store, or export your Salesforce metadata** outside your browser.

---

## 🔑 Salesforce Authentication & Access

The extension uses your **existing Salesforce browser session** to function.

Important details:

* ✔ Uses Salesforce session cookies already present in your browser
* ✔ Does **not** require OAuth setup
* ✔ Does **not** store usernames or passwords
* ✔ Does **not** store session IDs persistently
* ✔ Does **not** bypass Salesforce security mechanisms

All Salesforce API requests are made **directly from your browser to Salesforce**.

---

## 💾 Local Storage Usage

The extension may use Chrome’s **local or sync storage** only for **non-sensitive preferences**, such as:

* Selected metadata types
* Selected metadata components
* Salesforce API version preference
* UI preferences (theme, layout state)

This data:

* Is stored **locally in your browser**
* Is **never sent outside the browser**
* Can be cleared at any time via Chrome extension settings

No Salesforce business data is permanently stored.

---

## 🧱 Network & Remote Code Policy

Salesforce Package XML Generator:

* ❌ Does not load remote scripts
* ❌ Does not execute third-party code from external sources
* ❌ Does not embed trackers or analytics libraries

All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets are:

* Bundled with the extension
* Executed locally
* Fully auditable in the source code

This ensures a **secure, predictable, and transparent execution environment**.

---

## 🔒 Permissions Explanation

The extension requests **only the minimum permissions required** to function:

### **`storage`**

Used to store non-sensitive user preferences (metadata selections, UI state).

### **Host permissions (Salesforce domains)**

Used only to:

* Detect Salesforce org context
* Call Salesforce Tooling API and Metadata API
* Validate active Salesforce sessions

No permission is used to:

* Read browsing history
* Access non-Salesforce websites
* Track user behavior

---

## 🧪 Offline & Local-Only Processing

* Metadata selection, package generation, and previews are handled locally
* Generated `package.xml` files are created entirely in-browser
* No metadata is uploaded or shared

The extension does **not function as a proxy or data exporter**.
